         <ul>
             <li>Database: stores users for login, stores system & alter names, name colors, post date/times, etc.</li>
             <li>Ajax Usage: every button click on this website sends an Ajax POST request to update the database & retrieve new information if necessary, followed by a live jQuery update to the page. I also used Ajax to call the same header & footer files and apply them to every page.</li>
             <li>Theme: In addition to the Ajax-rendered header & footer menus, I've created a global CSS file which every page pulls from, as well as their individual CSS files as needed.</li>
             <li>New Library Usage: Flask, SQLAlchemy, and JSColor (the hex color picker on the homepage)</li>
             <li>Javascript: jQuery is used to update pages after Ajax calls. There is also a JS confirmation alert when you try to delete an alter profile, and if you remove every alter, you'll get an alert about that when trying to post a message.</li>
             <li>Membership Area: The "Home" and "Profile" links are not shown & cannot be accessed until you login  (you'll be redirected to the login page). You can login with the demo account or make your own to gain access.</li>
             <li>General User: You can use the demo account credentials specified in the assignment specs.</li>
         </ul>
